Project Overview
This project involves the refactoring and optimization of the product controller, front-end, admin controller, and routes to improve security, maintainability, and code reusability. Various features such as service and repository patterns, form validation, image trait, and layout organization have been incorporated to enhance the overall structure.
Steps to Refactor and Optimize
1. Product Controller and Frontend Refactoring

- Moved product-related functions to the **ProductController** to enhance organization and clarity.
- Frontend-related actions were shifted into the **HomeController** to separate concerns of frontend and backend functionality.
- This restructuring improves code clarity and maintenance by following the **single responsibility principle**.

2. Admin Controller Optimization

- The **AdminController** now only contains login and logout-related functions.
- A session check is included to verify if the user is logged in; if logged in, the user is redirected to the admin dashboard. Otherwise, the user is redirected to the login page for security purposes.
- This approach ensures that unauthorized users cannot access admin routes without authentication.

3. Service and Repository Pattern

- Introduced **Service** and **Repository** patterns within the **ProductController** for better separation of concerns and to make the code more scalable and testable.
- **Services** handle business logic, and **Repositories** handle data persistence, making the application more modular and easier to maintain.
- This structure enables easy modification and testing of individual components.

4. Form Validation Refactoring

- Form validation logic has been moved to a separate **validation file** to avoid duplication within the controller.
- This makes the code more organized and ensures that form validation logic is reusable across different parts of the application.

5. Image Trait for Image Management

- A **trait** was added to handle image upload and removal operations, avoiding repetitive code.
- The trait contains methods for adding and removing images, which can be used across different controllers and models, making the image handling process more efficient.
- This results in cleaner and more maintainable code, especially when dealing with file operations in multiple places.

6. Route Optimization

- Routes have been corrected and optimized to align with the newly refactored controllers.
- This includes cleaning up redundant routes and ensuring that each route corresponds to the appropriate controller and method.

7. Layout Optimization for Product CRUD and Frontend

- Layouts were added to the **Product CRUD** and **frontend** to remove duplication.
- By utilizing a common layout, repetitive HTML code was eliminated, improving code maintainability and consistency across the frontend and backend views.

Conclusion

These changes ensure that the code is more organized, maintainable, and scalable. The separation of concerns between different parts of the application allows for easier testing and modification. Additionally, security has been improved by limiting access to the admin panel and ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive routes.
